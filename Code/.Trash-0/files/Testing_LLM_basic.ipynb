      "\n",
      "The goal of data visualization is to help users:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Understand complex data: By presenting data in a visual format, it becomes easier to comprehend and analyze.\n",
      "2. Identify patterns and trends: Visualization helps to highlight relationships between different data points and detect potential anomalies.\n",
      "3. Make informed decisions: Visualizations can be used to support decision-making by providing a clear and concise overview of the data.\n",

      "Types of Data Visualization:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Bar charts**: Used to compare categorical data across multiple categories.\n",

      "3. **Choose the right chart type**: Select a chart type that best suits the data and message you want to convey.\n",
      "4. **Use color effectively**: Use colors consistently and sparingly to avoid visual overload.\n",
      "5. **Make it interactive**: Consider adding interactivity to your visualization to allow users to explore the data in more detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tools for Data Visualization:\n",
