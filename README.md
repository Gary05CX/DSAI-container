## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

### Running the Containers
To start all the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, use the following command:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

### Stopping the Containers
To stop the running containers, use `CTRL+C`( `âŒƒ+C`) or:

```shell
docker-compose down
```

## Storage Information

- **Workspace**: The workspace directories in each service folder are used for persistent data or code related to specific projects or configurations.
- **Database Data**: The `.database_data` directories in the MongoDB and PostgreSQL folders are used to store database files persistently, ensuring data is not lost when containers are stopped or removed.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the ports listed above are not in use by other applications on your host machine to avoid conflicts.
- For individual container configurations or to modify settings, refer to the respective `dockerfile` and `overrides.json` files located in each service's directory.
